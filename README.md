## üìù Introduction

This paper introduces a revolutionary approach: **Dynamic Activity Inference via Collaborative Learning**. Traditional methods for human activity recognition (HAR) on mobile devices are rigid and lack adaptability to changing resource constraints. Our method breaks this mold by training subnetworks at different widths and resolutions, enabling dynamic accuracy-latency trade-offs at runtime. Unlike conventional approaches requiring multiple networks, ours seamlessly switches between configurations without retraining, slashing costs. Extensive experiments validate its efficacy.



#### ‚ú®Compared to existing works, Dynamic Activity Inference via Collaborative Learning achieves:

- **Generalizability**: It adapts to a wide range of real-world scenarios without the need for human-specific fine-tuning. Previous methods often specialize in specific domains, limiting their applicability.

- **State-of-the-art Results**: Our approach achieves current state-of-the-art performance in human activity recognition.


#### üåüWith this project, you can:

- Utilize our easy-to-use codebase for re-implementation and further development.
  
- Experience our model or deploy the model for inference locally.
  
- Explore a plethora of research directions for enhancing activity recognition systems.
