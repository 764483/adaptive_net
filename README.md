## üìù Introduction

This paper introduces a revolutionary approach: **Dynamic Activity Inference via Collaborative Learning**. Traditional methods for human activity recognition (HAR) on mobile devices are rigid and lack adaptability to changing resource constraints. Our method breaks this mold by training subnetworks at different widths and resolutions, enabling dynamic accuracy-latency trade-offs at runtime. Unlike conventional approaches requiring multiple networks, ours seamlessly switches between configurations without retraining, slashing costs. Extensive experiments validate its efficacy.

#### ‚ú®Compared to existing works, Dynamic Activity Inference via Collaborative Learning achieves:

- **Generalizability**: It adapts to a wide range of real-world scenarios without the need for human-specific fine-tuning. Previous methods often specialize in specific domains, limiting their applicability.

- **State-of-the-art Results**: Our approach achieves current state-of-the-art performance in human activity recognition.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 
- PyTorch 1.11.0
- Numpy 1.23.4
- pyyaml 5.1


### Training
#### UniMiB-SHAR dataset
```
python train.py --model_name='unimib'                      # CNN
python train.py --model_name='resnet_unimib'               # ResNet
```
#### WISDM dataset
```
python train.py --model_name='wisdm'                       # CNN
python train.py --model_name='resnet_wisdm'                # ResNet
```
#### UCI-HAR dataset
Get UCI dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), do data pre-processing by sliding window strategy and split the data into training and test sets
```
python train.py --model_name='uci'                         # CNN
python train.py --model_name='resnet_uci'                  # ResNet
```
### Results
